# leader_Bord

The code starts by adding a submit event listener to a form. It prevents the default form submission behavior using e.preventDefault().

It retrieves user inputs (first name, last name, country, and score) and checks if any of them are empty. If any field is empty, it displays an error message.

If all fields are filled, it creates a new scoreboard entry with the user's information, including their name, timestamp, country, and score.

The new scoreboard entry is added to the scoreboard container and the scoreboard is sorted to display the highest scores at the top.

Event listeners for buttons in the scoreboard entry are activated, allowing users to delete entries or add/subtract from scores.

There's a generateDateAndTime function to generate a timestamp with the current date and time.

this code allows users to enter player information and scores in a form, which is then displayed in a scoreboard. The scoreboard can be sorted by score, and users can perform actions on each entry, such as deleting entries or modifying scores
